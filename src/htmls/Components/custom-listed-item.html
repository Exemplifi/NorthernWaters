            <h4 class="custom-list-heading">Planning</h4>
            <p class="custom-list-desc">Investigating and planning the C-BT Project involved a great deal of ingenuity and time exploring the mountain peaks and valleys of Colorado's Northern Front Range. While the project incorporates a complex system of reservoirs, pump plants, tunnels, pipelines and power plants, at its core the C-BT Project relies on two basic forces of nature: melting snow and gravity.</p>

            <h4 class="custom-list-heading">Water Source</h4>
            <p class="custom-list-desc">Nearly all of the project's water comes from snowmelt in the Upper Colorado River basin, located in Rocky Mountain National Park and Grand County. Eighty percent of Colorado's precipitation occurs on the West Slope of the Continental Divide, mostly in the form of snow. Northeastern Colorado only receives 14.5 inches of average annual precipitation, with most irrigated crops requiring at least twice that amount. Midwestern states such as Illinois, receive about 40 inches of average annual precipitation, and an East Coast state like Maine receives nearly 50 inches. Snowmelt is stored in Lake Granby – the state's second largest water body – as well as water collected in Willow Creek Reservoir.</p>

            <h4 class="custom-list-heading">Pumping to the Tunnel</h4>
            <p class="custom-list-desc">From Lake Granby, water is lifted by Farr Pump Plant into the Granby Pump Canal feeding Shadow Mountain Reservoir and Grand Lake. Water then flows from Grand Lake into the West Portal of the 13.1-mile <a href="#">Alva B. Adams Tunnel</a>.</p>

            <h4 class="custom-list-heading">Crossing the Mountains</h4>
            <p class="custom-list-desc">Once water exits the tunnel's East Portal, it descends the Front Range mountains nearly 2,600 vertical feet and passes through five power plants and four reservoirs. The hydropower generated provides a clean, renewable supply of power for Northeastern Colorado and the Western United States.</p>

            <h4 class="custom-list-heading">Storage and Distribution</h4>
            <p class="custom-list-desc">Along the Front Range foothills, C-BT Project water is stored in three terminal reservoirs – Horsetooth Reservoir, Carter Lake and Boulder Reservoir. These reservoirs provide both storage and great opportunities for water-based recreation, including boating, fishing, waterskiing, swimming and more. From these reservoirs C-BT Project water is distributed via a series of canals and pipelines to irrigated farms, as well as industries, utilities, cities, towns and rural domestic water districts. A total of 33 municipalities receive a portion of their water through the C-BT Project, along with 120 ditch, reservoir and irrigation companies.</p>
